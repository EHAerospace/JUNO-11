# JUNO-11
JUNO-11 is the first rocket of EHAerospace. This is the code of the Arduino based payload of the rocket. The function of this is to deploy the JUNOÂ´s parachute in the right moment to land safely.

#The code
The arduino(1) (PARACGUTE_SOFTW._JUNO-10.ino) reads data from the barometric pressure sensor BMP180 and when it detects a high negative altiude change activates the pin 2
to deploy the parachute.
The oder arduino(2)(Data_colector-1beta.ino) aboard JUNO collects data about altitude and temperature and transmittes it via I2C. When the rocket lands oder arduino is conected via I2C with the data collector arduino(3) and the data is visualized in a laptop.

#Rocket design
JUNO was designed in Open Rocket. Open Rocket is a free open source program to design rockets. You need this program to open JUNO-11.ork, you can download Open Rocket from: http://openrocket.sourceforge.net/.

The engine nozzle mold and the rocket nosecone are in .STL file to 3d print.
